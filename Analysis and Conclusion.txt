OBESITY, INCOME AND  FOOD  ACCESS




In this project, we aimed to investigate possible factors that impact the obesity rate in Oklahoma. We were interested in income, access to grocery stores (hoping to see a relationship to “food deserts”), access to fast food, and available transportation. Through a comprehensive exploration of these possible relationships, we aspire to contribute valuable insights that can inform policies and interventions aimed at addressing public health challenges associated with socio-economic disparities and nutritional access.


Question 1: How does income affect the chances of developing obesity?


Scatter plot of income vs. obesity rate. Most of the points are skewed right and are below an average income of $50,000, and above an obesity rate of 35%.


Question 2: How does proximity to grocery stores impact obesity?
This exploration of data shows there is likely a relationship between the number of grocery stores accessible (within 5 miles) and the obesity rate. However, this aspect of the project has several limitations including:


* Rural areas may likely be farming/ranching communities who do not rely heavily on store bought goods. 


* GeoApify may not have included smaller mom & pop stores more common in smaller towns, or other stores that carry grocery items.


* The variety of items at the grocery stores was not looked at and could have an impact on obesity rates. (i.e. Sprouts vs. Dollar General)




Question 3: How does the number of fast food restaurants in a given area impact obesity?


Through the analysis I have conducted it is clear that the number of fast food restaurants and obesity rate is connected in some way, perhaps not the way I had initially assumed though.


This project has brought up several other questions that we could explore and dig deeper with to get a clearer idea on other potential causes: 
* What types of fast food are people consuming the most in certain areas? 
* Would people be willing to drive further for their favorite fast food rather than the grocery store? 
* How often are people eating out rather than at home? 
* How do more rural areas impact the dataset?




Question 4: Does access to public transportation affect accessibility obesity?


It appears that there is a minimal correlation between obesity rates and access to public transportation. The calculated R-squared value, which measures the proportion of the variance in one variable that is predictable from another, stands at a mere 0.12. This low R-squared value suggests that only a small fraction of the variability in obesity rates can be explained by access to public transportation. Thus, it seems that other factors beyond transportation accessibility play a larger role in influencing obesity rates.
